# SN7313_IW5MP
A pretty crappy IW5MP 1.4.382 hack.

## Info:
The following piece of code is a compiling and working hack for the iw5mp executable in the version 1.4.382. As the code is pretty old,
it isn't written nicely, not even okay, this shouldn't be taken as an example of good code, neither the style imitadet. Additionally it was
never finished completely. 
Summing it up:
sh*tty unfinished code, but works.
